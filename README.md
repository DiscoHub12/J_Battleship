Naval Battle is a hugely popular, world-wide two-player pencil and paper game. 
Four tables (two per player), all of equal size, are required 
to play naval battle. 
The squares of the table are identified by pairs of coordinates, 
corresponding to row and column.
A "ship" occupies a number of adjacent squares in a straight line 
(horizontal or vertical) on the board.
Once the ships are positioned, the game proceeds in turns. 
The player whose turn it is "fires a shot" by declaring a square.
The opponent checks on his own grid if that cell is occupied by
one of his ships.
If so, he replies "impressed!" and mark that square on your table.
On the second table provided, the players note the shots they have fired 
and their outcome. When a hit hits the last square of a ship not yet sunk, 
the player who takes the hit must declare "hit and sunk!" and the ship is 
considered lost. The player who sinks all of his opponent's ships first wins.

Project developed in Java, it provides an implementation of the Naval Battle. 
There is no type of graphical interface (View) but it consists of the code, the Model.
